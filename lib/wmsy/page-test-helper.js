 *  to be able to show off our cool unit tests or something.  In any event, we
 *  need a way to support both fast tests and taking a looky loo.  We've been
 *  using page-worker so far for actual tests (which is nice because we avoid
 *  paint costs), but for running, we want to create tabs in the browsery
