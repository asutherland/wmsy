/**
 * Unified error handling of user-induced failures; be able to do something
 *  friendly and useful when something bad happens rather than throwing a
 *  baroque error message.
 *
 * To simplify control flow analysis and code understanding, all error handling
 *  methods return an error suitable for throwing.  So the idiom is always
 *  "throw $exploders.badSomething(args);".
 *
 * For now, the assumption is that the user is always a developer and the
 *  developer will simply run with break-on-exception active and the
 *  debugger context will be sufficient.  Because the throw happens after we
 *  return, our value add is currently just nice messages logged to the console.
 *
 * In the future we would likely want a few modes of operation:
 *
 * @itemize[
 *   @item{
 *     Productized mode where failures are unexpected and should be contained
 *     so as not to break the whole UI.  The useful thing for the developer is
 *     some kind of debug dump summarizing the problem, potentially with
 *     a level of detail that is unlikely to ever include private detail and
 *     then a more extensive level of detail that could leak data and so
 *     needs user redaction or acknowledgement of acceptance of providing the
 *     data.
 *   }
 *   @item{
 *     Hand-holding developer mode.  Attempt to automatically infer the likely
 *     reasons for the error and suggest fixes, with a "conservative" summary of
 *     the context.  Conservative means we want to avoid accidentally sucking
 *     down the entire object model into the error representation.
 *   }
 *   @item{
 *     Native debugger support, the same as we have now.  Just enable kicking
 *     the developer into the debugger without trying to save them from reality.
 *     Ideally we can then provide debugger plugins or JS console accessible
 *     helpers to make working in this fashion easier and with fewer rote
 *     actions required to figure out what is going on.
 *   }
