/**
 * Focus is annoying.
 *
 * The user-visible big picture is that they can tab between containers and
 * inside the containers use arrow keys to get around.
 *
 * Our implementation operates on the roaming tabIndex mode of operation.  The
 * choice of this over aria-activedescendant is made because:
 * - It makes more sense to conform to the DOM's idea of focus rather than the
 *   ARIA model which appears to not currently be reflected in the DOM.  This
 *   is especially pertinent for :focused magic selectors.
 * - We currently don't label all our nodes with id's (which activedescendant
 *   requires) and aren't particularly likely to ever need them since the wmsy
 *   model abhors global knowledge.  (However we might do so for optimization
 *   purposes if our direct DOM node references are causing GC or cross-process
 *   problems.)
 * - aria-activedescendant is writable and it's not clear that this is a
 *   compatible mode of operation when we get to widgets that only render a
 *   subset of the actual underlying data.
 *
 * General assumptions of our focus model:
 * - Our focus granularity is on a (sub)widget basis.  A single (sub)widget
 *   can either be focusable in its entirety or a container that holds other
 *   containers or things that are focusable.
