The debug UI exposes the registered wmsy widgets and their relations in the
abstract as well as the emergent configurations when used.  The goal is to
complement existing lower level debugging tools like firebug.  We should
only duplicate functionality (for example DOM inspector-like functionality)
if we can provide some serious value-add and creating a firebug extension
would be harder to use for developers or an order of magnitude more code.
