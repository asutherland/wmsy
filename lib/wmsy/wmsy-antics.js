/**
 * All logic related to animations-related behaviors.
 *
 * Our goal with animation is to play to the strengths of the human visual
 *  system, attempting to expose causality and object relationships through
 *  animation.  For example, rather than have an object disappear from one
 *  list and appear in another, we would prefer it to transition between
 *  the two lists.  When deleting an object, we would prefer that it collapses
 *  rather than immediately disappear and have its neighbors move up.
 *
 * For our own sanity and simplicity of the rest of the system, we attempt to
 *  immediately effect the binding changes and just use a series of dumb
 *  DOM nodes and transitions to accomplish the rest.  Because binding logic
 *  in WidgetLists and the like ignores nodes without bindings, leaving DOM
 *  nodes (or clones) in places whose bindings have been destroyed is fine.
 *  (We do need to contend with widget destruction usually tearing down the
 *  DOM tree as a side-effect.)
 *
 * Non-listy widget bindings are somewhat more problematic because all of our
 *  DOM traversal logic assumes a fixed tree structure.  This is not a problem
 *  because the set of state changes possible for a non-listy widget can/should
 *  probably be constrained.
 *
 * Presumably if we have multiple flying antic operations happening at the same
 *  time we would use a timer to update the targets of all flying things so
 *  they don't end up in the wrong spot.  We are going to initially punt on
 *  that, however.
 *
 * We are able to associate the various types of transitions by relying on
 *  the already existing wmsy idspace mechanism to track the addition /
 *  removal of objects.
 *
 * The set of operations we support is as follows:
 * @itemize[
 *   @itemize{
 *     Addition.  The creation of a new instance that comes from nowhere.  The
 *     following techniques seem to cover the reasonable options for us:
 *
 *    @item[
 *     @item{
 *       Zoom/expand in using straight-up DOM transitions for everything.  The
 *       concern with this is that when text layout is involved it might
 *       actually change up the layout as it goes.  An alternate variant is
 *       the contract in from infinity while alphaing from clear to opaque.
 *     }
 *     @item{
 *       Zoom/expand in by taking a canvas shot of the widget in its realized
 *       form and having that be the thing that is scaled.  Thanks to our
 *       decision to limit the cascading bit of CSS to things inside the widget
 *       this does make it possible to snapshot it in isolation.  The only
 *       problem is when the widget is sized based on its position which
 *       might necessitate inserting it, reflowing, removing it, etc.  Another
 *       option could be to have the widget actually be resizing itself but
 *       invisible with the canvas thing just overlaid overtop.  (And since
 *       the css properties should presumably have calculated the end state,
 *       we are able to target the rigth end state.)
 *     }
 *     @item{
 *       Do a wipe/crop thing where overflow:none is used to have the node
 *       already fully sized but sort of sliding into existence fully formed.
 *       This has a similar issue to the former in that we really need to know
 *       the final size of things for this to work without relayout.
 *     }
 *     @item{
 *       Have an empty space open up and then the widget fades in quickly.  The
 *       goal is to avoid scaling the widget while also making sure the changes
 *       in its neighbors allow our visual centers to do the right thing.
 *     }
 *    ]
 *   }
 *   @item{
 *     Deletion.  The destruction of an existing instance that isn't going
 *     anywhere else.
 *
 *     All of our options are the same as in the addition case except we already
 *     know the size of the widget, which makes everything much simpler.
 *     We can directly perform a canvas snapshot in-situ, do the overflow:none,
 *     etc. tricks with no trouble whatsoever.
 *   }
 *   @item{
 *     Clones that fly from their cloning origin to their new instantiated
 *     location.
 *
 *     This is a variation on addition.  We want to create a clone of the
 *     origin node and have it fly to the new location.  We want to have the
 *     new location fully sized by the time the flying clone gets there.
 *     We want the growing location to be empty, which simplifies that.
 *
 *     So our strategy is to have two transitions.  One is the flying clone
 *     which is not a binding at all.  The other is the target node which is
 *     a real binding that is animating its sizing but whose visibility is
 *     hidden.  We register a listener on the flying dude and use that to
 *     make the target node visible.  Some fine-tuning may be in order,
 *     especially if there are cases where the conceptual object is the same
 *     but the binding or its state is not.
 *   }
 *
 *   @item{
 *     (Conceptual) object movement from one location to another; effectively
 *     cloning where the original is killed.
 *
 *     The target end is like copy cloning.  For the source end, since we want
 *     it to look like the thing is flying away, we immediately hide the
 *     (dead) source node and have it animate a collapse.  Once the collapse
 *     completes we remove the node.
 *   }
 * ]
