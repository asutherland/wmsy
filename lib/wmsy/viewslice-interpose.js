/**
 * Lets you insert synthetic phantom objects into a view slice.  You provide
 *  a simple classification function that is invoked on every item relevant to
 *  the visible range that distills a single integer or string result.  If
 *  the returned value is not equivalent for adjacent items, another routine
 *  you provide is invoked with the adjacent items in order to provide a new
 *  synthetic item.
 *
 * Synthetic items are regenerated if either of the adjacent items is updated
 *  or they are displaced or deleted.  This allows synthetic items to have
 *  their state depend on the specific objects rather than just the
 *  classification keys.  For example, when displaying a list of messages,
 *  you might quantize to the day as a classification key, but could still
 *  explicitly call out the exact time delta between two messages from different
 *  days.
 *
 * You would use this functionality for things like:
 * @itemize[
 *   @item{
 *     Putting giant letters in an address book to segment the address book by
 *     name.
