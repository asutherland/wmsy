/**
 * Enables you to take an object/context and find the most appropriate
 *  possibility previously registered (given per-possibility constraints.)
 *  We attempt to do this efficiently.
 *
 * Currently, constraints provide for:
 * - Checking that an attribute is not present.
 * - Checking that an attribute has a specific value.
 * - Checking that an attribute has a value and there is no specific value case
 *   covering it.
 *
 * Attributes may be nested arbitrarily deep inside objects.
 *
 * Our implementation is a decision-tree with support for partial evaluation
 *  of paths along the decision tree.
 *
 * In order to allow for predictable behaviour, each decision space is able to
 *  define an explicit ordering of attributes for consideration.  This makes
 *  our behaviour roughly analogous to multi-method dispatch where arguments
 *  are considered in a specific positional ordering (left-to-right, usually).
 * When an explicit prioritization is not in play, an arbitrary heuristic is
 *  used to decide the next attribute to consider which provides no guarantee of
 *  stability.  This is currently the count of the number of references to
 *  attributes by possibilities but could change in the future to favor
 *  attribute counts per partial evaluations, a weighted heuristic, or anything.
 *  The heuristic does know to defer attributes associated with WILD values to
 *  the end of the line because of the assumption it is used for
 *  parameterization.
 *
 *
 * We do not do the following, but could.  Note that in general, you can work
 *  around these limitations through the introduction of helper getters whose
 *  use replaces all references to the raw value.  The reason we do not do these
 *  things is that the limitation ensures that at any decision point a
 *  constraint will only continue to live-on in exactly one of the
 *  sub-decisions.
 * - Check that an attribute is present (and has any value).
 * - Check that an attribute does not have a specific value.
 * - Check that an attribute is LT/LTE/GT/GTE a value.
 * - Check that an attribute matches some regex.
 *
 *
 *
 * Our implementation assumes that there will be a reasonable amount of
 *  similarity between the constraints provided and that the pathological
 *  case of non-overlapping constraints will not occur.  If we thought
 *  non-overlapping cases were sufficiently probable we could require
 *  consistent ordering of constraint attributes (and evaluation sets) and/or
 *  use iteration over the evaluation set to avoid checking a lof of empty
 *  properties.
 *
 * @note As implemented, the decision process is arbitrary and therefore
 *  theoretically unsound.  This will likely be resolved at some point by
 *  having domains define a strict ordering of attribute importance.  This
 *  effectively turns us into multi-method dispatch

   * Build a decision tree for all of our existing constraints.
   *
   * In a simple world, we would only support constraints where the value is
   *  a primitive value (and not a sub-object).  In this simple world, we can
   *  build a decision tree by doing the following at each state:
   *
   * - Counting the number of times each attribute key is seen across the
   *    possible constraints at this part of the decision tree.
   * - Creating a new decision point that examines that key.  We partition the
   *    possible constraints at this part of the tree based on the key.  The
   *    possible resulting sets are constraints that didn't mention the key
   *    at all and a set for each specific value.  If there is only one
   *    constraint in the set, then it is an answer node and we can leave it
   *    like that.  Otherwise, we recursively apply our algorithm to each set.
   *
   * The complication is that we want to be able to express constraints on
   *  sub-objects as well.  The good news is that we can reduce the complex
   *  world to the simple world by flattening all nested objects into a series
   *  of independent sequential object traversals which we treat the same as
   *  straightforward primitives.  So the constraint "{a: {b: {c: 1}}}"
   *  effectively becomes "a.b.c" just like "{a: 1}" would be keyed using "a".
   * The potential inefficiency of this approach is that we perform redundant
   *  traversals.  For example, the constraint "{a: {b: {c: 1, d: 2}}}" would
   *  result in the flattened "a.b.c" and "a.b.d" where "a.b" is common.
   *  Without additional logic, we are likely to redundantly perform the
   *  traversal.  There are a number of ways to address this, but we are
   *  declaring this a non-problem.
   *
   *
   * Assuming 'n' is the number of constraints, 'k' is the maximum number of
   *  attribute parts per constraint and 't' is the total number of distinct
   *  attributes referenced: we expect to produce O(n) decision nodes with
   *  O(n log(n) k) annoying attribute traversals dominating.
