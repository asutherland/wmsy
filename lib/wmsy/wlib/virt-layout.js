/**
 * Child objects are categorized and each category laid out in 1-dimension.
 *  Placement along that axis is based on multi-segment linear interpolation.
 *  Our algorithm is to place bindings in strictly increasing ordering key value
 *  (which is the order in which the view slice gives them to us anyways).  Each
 *  object has an "effective duration" which is the lesser of the delta between
 *  it and the suceeding object's ordering key value, the actual duration value
 *  if one is provided, or the default presumed duration value.  The start and
 *  endpoints of the binding on the axis combined with the ordering key and
 *  effective duration define a linear interpolation segment.  Each new linear
 *  interpolation segment replaces any existint interpolation segment that it
 *  overlaps.
 *
 * A trivial example application of this functionality is placement of music
 *  albums on a timeline, categorized by artist.  The ordering key is the year
 *  of album release and the presumed duration value is 1 year.  This will
 *  result in albums from the same year by different artists being placed in
 *  parallel.  An album released a year after another album will always occur
 *  strictly "after" that album along the layout axis.
 *
 * A more complicated example in the same domain is to track release date down
 *  to the day of release and categorize based on whether a musical release is
 *  an album or a single.  For visual effect we might size the albums to be
 *  twice as large as the singles.  We might also set the presumed duration for
 *  albums at 1 year and singles at 1 month.  This will result in singles being
 *  visually clustered inside and around the album that spawned them while
 *  providing some relative positioning that looks cool.
 *
 * Because we want to allow for widget bindings to resize themselves in response
 *  to interactive events,
