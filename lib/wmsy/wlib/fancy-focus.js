 *     the scroll region, we are going to look stupid when the focused thing
 *     scrolls right out from under us.
 *
 *     This is dealt with by walking up the chain of bindings containing this

 *     If it has one, then we know that we need to transplant our DOM node into
 *     that scrolling DOM node once we are done animating.
