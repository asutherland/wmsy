Everything in here expects that this directory will have two directories alongside it:
- teleport from http://github.com/Gozala/teleport
- fakedata, with JSON files in it, currently tb31rcblockers.json

To get fake data, you would so something like the following, assuming BZUSERNAME and BZPASSWORD values are defined:

curl -o result.json -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org/latest/bug?username=$BZUSERNAME&password=$BZPASSWORD&id=554806,543737,524623,549931,562608,562934&include_fields=_default,attachments,blocks,cc,comments,depends_on,dupe_of,flags,groups,history,see_also,token"

You can also use other queries that the bugzilla REST API understands, but be aware that it does not support "quicksearch", so sometimes it might be easiest to run a quicksearch and then get your bug numbers from that.

In order to examine the json data, you may want to prettify it since the REST API gives it to you as one line.  The following simple python script can be useful if you don't have one already:

Caveats: if your password has characters in it that are weird URL-wise, you might want to change your password or just be very careful about correctly escaping them.
