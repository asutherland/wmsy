Everything in here expects that this directory will have two directories alongside it:
- teleport from http://github.com/Gozala/teleport
- fakedata, with JSON files in it, currently tb31rcblockers.json

To get fake data, you would so something like the following, assuming BZUSERNAME and BZPASSWORD values are defined:

curl -o result.json -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org/latest/bug?username=$BZUSERNAME&password=$BZPASSWORD&id=554806,543737,524623,549931,562608,562934&include_fields=_default,attachments,blocks,cc,comments,depends_on,dupe_of,flags,groups,history,see_also,token"

Caveats: if your password has characters in it that are weird URL-wise, you might want to change your password or just be very careful about correctly escaping them.
